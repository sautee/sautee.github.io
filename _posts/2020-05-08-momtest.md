Talking to and understanding users is perhaps an underrated skill in Product Management. 

Users are often the source of the ideas we use to build a product. Most Product Managers understand that we ought to talk to users.

Here's the stick. **Talking to users is hard**.

Bad conversations can result in false positives which ultimately leads to incorrect product decisions. 

Now there are other ways to see this process. For example, you could build a version (some call this the MVP - Minimum Viable Product) and then iterate over it a few times before it turns out right. But this assumes you have the right MVP to begin with. 

Engineering a product (or even a feature) is non-trivial - taking time, effort and resources. It could get to where the ship is too late to turn around.
