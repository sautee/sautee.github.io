Talking to and understanding customers is perhaps an underrated skill in Product Management. 

Customers are often the source of requirements for a product. Most Product Managers understand that talking to customers is vital.

Here's the stick. **Talking to customers is hard**.

Bad conversations can result in false positives leading to incorrect product decisions. 

Engineering a product (or feature) is non-trivial. Ideally, it is effort well spent.

## The Mom Test

[Rob Fitzpatrick](https://twitter.com/robfitz) addresses these customer conversations in his book [**The Mom Test**](http://momtestbook.com/). It is a ~130 page handbook of good story telling and practical insight. 

The book 'games' conversations with customers and points out where they usually go wrong.

### Useful conversation roadmap

- Ask good questions (don't ask 'is this a good idea?')
- Avoid bad data ('I would definitely buy that!' without commitment)
- Keep it casual (allow customer honesty to shine)
- Push for commitment & advancement ('you'll need to pay for this product')
- Frame the meeting (talk to industry experts, ask for help)
- Customer segmentation (target the right user group)
- Prep & review (prep the questions that'll pass the mom test)
- Take notes (take useful notes, share with the team)

**Rule of thumb**. you can't tell customers what their problem is, they can't tell you what to build.

Aim for good conversations. Mistakes will be made, but learn by having them often.
