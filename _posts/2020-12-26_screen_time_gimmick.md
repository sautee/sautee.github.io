Coffeezilla has a line that goes 'You can't be making money online making how to make money online video, if you spend your time watching how to make money online videos'. So I surface from my online rabbit hole to do something more useful with my time - this article.

This year produced 7 articles written sporadically through the year starting in April. The advice from many when maintaining a newsletter or blog is to find a overarching theme and to stick to it. You can find good examples of such blogs. Julie Zhoe on management, Hot House solutions on climate change to name a few.

More than writing, I put some effort coming up with a design and layout for the site. This also meant brushing up on my rusty HTML and CSS skills. You can achieve a lot with just those two. 

## Books

Most of the books I read this year revolved around Product Management.

The two most interesting books I read this year - 7 Habits of highly effective leadership and The Mom test. Though I read 7 habits a while back, it continues to be a gold mine of advice on leadership. I've been blessed to teach leadership to a group of high school students. One thing is sure. Teaching forces you to think deeply about what you read.

The Mom Test changed my view about customer discovery on its head. Till then I thought of user input as secondary and ideas brainstormed withing as the primary driver of a product

## Articles 

Most interesting article Ball don't lie. This was written in the aftermath of George Floyd. It talks about Black lives. It is easy to attach yourself with a movement but not do any real work behind it. You can see similar things happen with climate change. Real change requires real hard work.

## On writing 

Writing. Writing requires a certain discipline. When I started DoC, I wou ld work on an article a day or two at most and just get jt done with. The discipline is to hone an article over a couple of days.

## On Bahrain

We've been to the same malls a 100 times. Being a very small island country there is a sense of community. Of historic significance this year was the peace agreement signed with Israel. Bahrain's response to the Coronavirus has been effective. Masks and social distancing were enforced quite early. Bahrain's vaccination effort is second only to Israel. 



Remember to breathe.

Happy New Year!
