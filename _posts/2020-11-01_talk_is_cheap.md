My uncle passed away recently. His legacy of love, care and concern will live in my memory. I've been fortunate to have spent quite some time talking to and learing from him - he was the kind of person who would love to talk about his experiences and share lessosns he'd learnt.

Here are three.

1. Read as widely as you can

2. Do not take the words of anyone at face value

3. The small things matter

Opinion: the truest way of honoring loved one's who've passed away is by living.
