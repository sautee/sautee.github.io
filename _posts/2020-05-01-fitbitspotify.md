Marty Cagan [recently wrote](https://svpg.com/spotify-vs-fitbit/) an article on Fitbit, Spotify and empowered product teams. I strongly recommend reading it.

A primary takeaway from the article.

### Output vs Outcome
Spotify built a company worth more than $25B while competing (and winning) against heavyweights like Apple and Amazon.

While empowered engineering teams at Spotify helped deliver consistent innovation, Cagan goes on mention the requirement for a strong product leadership also. **Empowered product teams.**

Fitbit on the other hand, whilst also being in the hugely competitive wearables market, adopted the polar opposite of the empowered team model. This helped increase output but with far less innovation. In the wearables market innovation is key. This change in Fitbit's model resulted in depreciating business value.
