I can relate to this. I've been in similar conversations. The thread goes on.

I believe 'Product Manager as CEO' helps encapsulate the responsibility of the role in a few words. But attaching the term 'CEO' could leave room for it to be misunderstood as a role with simply more authority than with responsibility.
