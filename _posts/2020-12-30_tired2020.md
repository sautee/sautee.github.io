[Coffeezilla](https://youtu.be/CWMAOzH20mY) has a line that goes -

> You can't be making money online making how to make money online videos, if you spend your time watching how to make money online videos.

This year produced 7 articles written sporadically through the year starting in April. The advice from many who write a newsletter or blog is to find an overarching theme and to stick to it. [Julie Zhou's](https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/how-to-be-strategic-f6630a44f86b) on product and management, [Hothouse Solutions](https://hothouse.substack.com/p/the-future-of-food-is-in-your-own) on climate action are good examples. 

Writing, I've learnt, requires a certain discipline. When I started, I would attempt to write an article in no more than 30 minutes, in a single sitting. Not a good strategy. While this works sometimes, some article require crafting and shaping where you read and re-read to light up shadowy corners and cut off fluff. The [Notorious R.B.G](https://nysba.org/the-notorious-r-b-g-lessons-on-le-gal-writing-from-the-legendary-ruth-bader-ginsburg/) believed "the more effective a lawyer can be in speech and writing, the better professional he or she will be." This is true in more places than judicial writing - and especially for Product Managers.

I spent way too much time fiddling with the site's design and layout. It took quite some restraint to call it 'good enough'.

## Books

Some of the books I started this year I'm still working my way thru.

The two standouts - **The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People** and **The Mom test**. 

The Mom Test flipped my view on what to expect when talking to customers. Phrases such as 'customer empathy' and 'talk to your customers' is common.  The Mom Test reveals that this knowledge is insufficient. The book holds valuable lessons for any Product Manager. 

The 7 Habits posit is this - leadership begins with you, privately. 'Sow a thought, reap an action; sow an action, reap a habit; sow a habit, reap a character; sow a character, reap a destiny'. 

## Articles 

**Ball don't lie** by Jay Caspian Kang, written in the aftermath of George Floyd's death. It talks about Black lives. It is easy to attach yourself with a movement but not do any real work behind it. You can see similar things happen with climate change. Real change requires real hard work.

## On Bahrain

We've been to the same malls a 100 times. Being a very small island country there is a sense of community. Of historic significance this year was the peace agreement signed with Israel. Bahrain's response to the Coronavirus has been effective. Masks and social distancing were enforced quite early. Bahrain's vaccination effort is second only to Israel.

Fish man

No one needs to be told how Coronavirus felt like.

Remember to breathe.

Happy New Year
