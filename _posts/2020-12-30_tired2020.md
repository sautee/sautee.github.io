> You can't be making money online making how to make money online videos, if you spend your time watching how to make money online videos.

I've been wanting to start writing for sometime. I'm glad I made some headway. This year produced 7 articles written sporadically through the year starting in April. The advice from many who write a newsletter or blog is to find an overarching theme and to stick to it. [Julie Zhou's](https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/how-to-be-strategic-f6630a44f86b) on product and management, [Hothouse Solutions](https://hothouse.substack.com/p/the-future-of-food-is-in-your-own) on climate action are good examples. 

Writing, I've learnt, requires a certain discipline. When I started, I would attempt to write an article in no more than 30 minutes, in a single sitting. While this works sometimes, some article require crafting and shaping where you read and re-read to reveal shadowy corners and cut off fluff. The [Notorious R.B.G](https://nysba.org/the-notorious-r-b-g-lessons-on-le-gal-writing-from-the-legendary-ruth-bader-ginsburg/) believed 

> The more effective a lawyer can be in speech and writing, the better professional he or she will be.

This is true in more places than judicial writing - and especially for Product Managers.

I spent way too much time fiddling with the site's design and layout. It took quite some restraint to call it 'good enough'.

## Books

I go at sloth speed when it comes to reading books. Some books I'm still working my way thru.

The two most interesting ones I read(ing) this year - **The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People** and **The Mom test**. 

The Mom Test flipped my view on how to talk to customers and what to expect from it. It is not enough to know that you must interact with customers. The book holds valuable lessons for any Product Manager. 

A maxim from 7 Habits is this - 'Sow a thought, reap an action; sow an action, reap a habit; sow a habit, reap a character; sow a character, reap a destiny'. This massively oversimplifies the book. I recommend reading it.

## Articles 

**Ball don't lie** by . This was written in the aftermath of George Floyd. It talks about Black lives. It is easy to attach yourself with a movement but not do any real work behind it. You can see similar things happen with climate change. Real change requires real hard work.

## On Bahrain

We've been to the same malls a 100 times. Being a very small island country there is a sense of community. Of historic significance this year was the peace agreement signed with Israel. Bahrain's response to the Coronavirus has been effective. Masks and social distancing were enforced quite early. Bahrain's vaccination effort is second only to Israel.

Fish man

No one needs to be told how Coronavirus felt like.

Remember to breathe.

Happy New Year
