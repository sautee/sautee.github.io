### Why Product Strategy Fails
Freek Vermulen - [HBR](https://hbr.org/2017/11/many-strategies-fail-because-theyre-not-actually-strategies)

- Real strategy is a clear set of choices - what we're going to do and what not going to do
- Many so called *strategies* are in fact goals or priorities (increase revenue in X)
- Clear strategy - (1) we're going to address X (2) for Y (3) so that they can do Z
- Employees should be aware of choices made and believe in them
- Empower employees to create button up initiatives that fall within the choices made
- Change the way you do things unless the old way is substantially better

### Unglue your strategy
Rita Gunther McGrath - [HBR](https://hbr.org/2013/06/transient-advantage)

- Competitive advantage is transient 
- Abandon the idea that stability in business is the norm
- Embrace continuous change, avoid rigidity
- Strategy should be fluid, customer centric, less industry bound

- New markets have no customers or competitors, talk to people to figure how your product might change their day to day
