### On Customer Empathy
Nicole Westman - [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2021/1/31/22256167/covid-vaccine-website-nyc-appointment)

- As a user, the system I use should work for me instead of me having to work the system.
- A great recent example is techies and volunteers banding up to create easy to use websites that scrape COVID vaccination appointments from multiple locations into one place.
- Their efforts made it easier for older folk, the primary initial target group, to easily find appointments and sign up for them.
- This in place of state websites that failed to be user friendly for this group.
- Examples - [New York](https://nycvaccinelist.com/), [California](https://www.vaccinateca.com/), [Massachusetts](https://www.macovidvaccines.com/)

### Why Product Strategy Fails
Freek Vermeulen - [HBR](https://hbr.org/2017/11/many-strategies-fail-because-theyre-not-actually-strategies)

- Real strategy is a clear set of choices - what we're going to do and what *not* going to do
- Many so called 'strategies' are in fact goals or priorities (increase revenue in X)
- Clear strategy - (1) we're going to address X (2) for Y (3) so that they can do Z
- Everyone is aligned  - imagine your team is wildly successful in 3 years. What does that look like?
- Empower the team to create bottom up initiatives within the purview of these choices (instead of pushing top down)

### Unglue Your Strategy
Rita Gunther McGrath - [HBR](https://hbr.org/2013/06/transient-advantage)

- Competitive advantage is transient 
- Abandon the idea that stability in business is the norm
- Embrace continuous change, avoid rigidity
- Strategy should be fluid, customer centric, less industry bound

### Four Types of Markets
Steve Blank - [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-232B-243)

- There are 4 types of markets - Existing, Resegmented, New, Clone
- Know the market you are in - it is important 
- Strategy and tactics for one market type seldom work for another
- Tools like [customer discovery](https://steveblank.com/2020/04/07/customer-discovery-in-the-time-of-the-covid-19-virus/) prove vital
